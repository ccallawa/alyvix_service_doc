.. rubric:: Build and run an Alyvix RDC test case in NetEye

This video takes a look at the entire Alyvix Service lifecycle when it's used together with a
monitoring system and focused on checking remote applications.  We build a complete test case
from scratch that uses Remote Desktop (RDC) to log in to a remote server, run an application
there, and receive and review reports that include timing data and screenshots of each
measured task step.
