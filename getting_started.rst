Getting Started
===============

If you're new to Alyvix Core or Alyvix Service, read the `overview <introduction.html>`_ to
get up to speed.  When you're ready to start using Alyvix Service, read the
`install page <install.html>`_.  Once the Alyvix Service is up and running on Windows,
you can begin to use it with a compatible monitoring system.

At this point, you can use your monitoring system to configure your sessions, schedule your
Alyvix test cases for execution, explore the results in your monitoring system's native
visualization system, and look at reports that detail every step of Alyvix Robot
execution runs, successful or not.
